checkpoint three temproary addresses for important variables:
pass time value to function: 0x100000a0
state: 0x100000c0
SW_RTC: 0x100000c4
timer_print_bit: 0x100000c8
inIdx: 0x100000d0
outIdx: 0x100000d4
buffer: 0x100000d8


start program: 0x10000d00

spec broken down:
isr resides in start.s (isr folder) 

timer isr: 
add 1 second to compare register (50M cycles)
if timer_print_bit is set:
	send out through uart in mm:ss using out(s) (s is a string)

rtc_isr:
increment every time count overflows
assume each overflow is one minute (80sseconds)

UARTRX_isr: (done in assembly in start.s)
receive from UART, store to STATE
case (state)
	e: set timer_print_bit (global var)
	d: clear timer_print_bit
	else stores into STATE (used by application code)

UARTTX_isr: 
if FIFO empty (inIdx == outIdx) send null (or carat for debugging)
otherwise dequeue from fifo
jal to write_UART
